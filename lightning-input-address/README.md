This provides a LWC to use lightning-input-address among with dependent values.

Instead of using the standard Address values, you can store the desired countries and the related states in two fields and create field dependencies between them.

The LWC will fetch them and when the user changes the country, the states will change as well.

Make sure you reference the correct fields in the LWC.
