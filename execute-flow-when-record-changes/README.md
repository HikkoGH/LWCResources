# Execute/Restart a flow when record changes

Use this package to embed a flow inside a record page, and you want the flow
to execute when the record page changes.

## Before this flow
If you had a flow inside a lightning page that displays record's information, when the record changes, users had to manually refresh the page to see the changes reflected in the flow

## Using this flow
When the record is updated, the flow will re-execute.
